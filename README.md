# Animations
All the *PARENTS* and Names of every animation in the Animations folder of RoCitizen's is kept here. 

# Information

## Format

The format is a custom shitty format made by me, RobloxArchiver. :)

Explanation Below!

```lua
local anim_30108_4675 = Guns["Gun Reload Gangster"]
--    ^    ^     ^      ^    ^
--    P1   P2    P3     P4   P5
```

## P1

P1 is the type of dump, in this case Anim is selfexplainable, it's an animation!

## P2

P2 is the index of the said dump item. 

## P3

P3 is a randomly generated number from the sets of `1000, 9999`. This is for no reason just... Convenience! 

## P4

P4 is the parent of the dump, or the file it was *parented* to.

## P5

P5 is the name of said dump item, this case animation.
